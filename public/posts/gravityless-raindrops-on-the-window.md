The first time I got a note in my envelope for 1-on-1, I opened it, hoping to see something wholesome. And then, I saw ‚ÄúHi I was your intro-er. you seem so _badass_...‚Äù

I was definitely frozen, feeling like I had just been pushed into an express to the north pole, or fallen into an ice hole with infinite depth. _What does it even mean by that ‚Äúbadass‚Äù??_ Congrats! Gained the first hater on the second day of camp! Definitely something that I dreamed of for the whole half year after receiving the acceptance sent by ASPR! Panicking, I handed the message to CL[1](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-1-148573217) ‚ÄúHi C, do you know what it means by saying ur badass?? Is it something like an asshole??‚Äù Thank god it‚Äôs a positive word, though I have no idea why bad and ass can combine to be a positive word (negative*negative = positive), erm actually here we use multiplication instead of addition for word meanings..? ü§ìüëÜ

Anyway, this is something funny on the first few days (I guess this is official Day 1 and I ghosted because I was scared thinking it was a negative word, the next day I asked CL and I later talked to CW on Day 3?? My brain is rusting)

The strongest feeling is that everyone here is worth _stalking_. This is a very strange claim, to elaborate, people here are all very interesting and good at something (but they hardly talk abt and it's hard to discover without stalking). Such a pity that my 3rd party assigned person is D, who is definitely not chronically online though he's often spotted with his laptop managing his code. Even his twitter's full of academic stuff..? So the only pieces of info I had about him are just: [specific org], pre-doc, [specific uni], economics economics economics... After listening to him chit-chatting with someone I gained the _precious_ info that he likes chocolate tropical‚Ä¶ to be honest if I were assigned to introduce [a mysterious huge sweat], I could start from [specific crazy club], taking [specific ap exam] in middle school and 3[2](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-2-148573217) [specific cracked summer camp] + 2 [specific cracked program] experiences üòÇ. Also due to this reason I didn't know how cracked they were until I started stalking[3](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-3-148573217).

However, though everyone I met here excelled in at least one subject/field, there's 0% arrogance, pretentiousness, and all other things I might plan to see from anyone from these backgrounds.

All the JCs/counselors/instructors (I have little idea of the differences at least from what I saw, it's not that differentiated like ross) are nice, even though I regret I don‚Äôt have the time to have 1-on-1 with most of them. I should copy JE‚Äôs plan, to have one-on-one with everyone. It is strange to call them ‚Äújunior counselors‚Äù because I was also assigned the tag in Ross but I am <5% experienced compared to this camp's JCs which is _super eMBaRRaSSiNG_. Among all the JCs, I should say, I ‚Äúobserved‚Äù CW, S, J, Y, and B the most, though it‚Äôs very hard to have deep conversations. A lot of my 1-on-1s are not deep, some of them can dive only to the depth such that ‚Äúthey kinda know ur life experience‚Äù, and distractors ‚Äúwith high frictional constant‚Äù (aka ppl started talking things in these topics and can't go back to what they originally talked abt) such as yapping, Jane Street, college app, future career consideration, NON-TRIVIAL IS A CULT[4](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-4-148573217), prevented us from diving deeper. This is, at least, a problem for me. I sometimes feel that very deep conversations, maybe on some philosophical topics[5](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-5-148573217), only appear depending on luck..? Though I should say topics considering future careers ~~, why you should not take a job in Jane Street~~ are also deep enough for conversations with people I have met for only <10 days.

Away from those, I nominate CW and J as people with the best music taste, 10000% appreciation for that. CW is the best playlist maker I discovered from Day 1 (I am now listening to her playlist lol[6](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-6-148573217)[7](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-7-148573217)[8](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-8-148573217), I should save some points in the auction for this. I really need a very good playlist, Spotify auto rec just sucks[9](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-9-148573217)). 

Everything satisfying aside, I just felt regretful only talking to a few people. I should be more prepared to have intensive social activities. I WAS PROCRASTINATING ON HAVING 1-ON-1s WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME..? i have been considering having 1-on-1 with J on approximately Day 6 or 7 but somewhat got scared from talking to people from nowhere..? I am generally afraid of wasting time just talking abt ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs ur life story / why do u choose this major‚Äù[10](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-10-148573217) no idea what kind of people will enjoy and I also want to escape from getting answers like ‚ÄúI have no idea why I choose this major maybe it‚Äôs something in my gene that motivates me to become the ultimate environmentalist/math enjoyer/oly grinder‚Äù ~~automatically take this as the paraphrased version of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good approach to the t10 colleges / it can help me find a high salary job‚Äù~~.

So this has been a dilemma for me: on the one hand I definitely enjoy staying with people more than just locking myself in the dorm[11](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-11-148573217), but at the same time I am afraid of communicating. Being scared of chatting about boring stuff that wastes our time also influences me to avoid conversations in general. The age and experience barrier make me confused abt whether something that‚Äôs interesting to me will sound interesting to you, too[12](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-12-148573217). The best ‚Äúsocializing‚Äù approach for me may be just sitting together with someone but staring at my own laptop, and chatting if I just come out with something funny ~~(just realized this is Ross pset mode no way my other fav camp shaped me as introvert 10% autistic weirdo üóø)~~

But other than that, it has been so great so far. Something I thank the most in ESPR is that I am free to do things, without getting judged. Also, I get to talk with people from diverse different cultural backgrounds (despite the truth that some of them are not that deep). The greatest non-academic stuff I did was officially picking up art again (?). This idea gradually started from Ross '24, when A was creating a realistic illustration for her dad. I thought of how I used to be passionate about art, though I left this hobby locked in my childhood together with my primary school sweet memories of sketching anime characters on the desk ~~and in my textbooks~~ with friends and the satisfaction I used to gain when doing art stuff ~~this should be partly due to the unease with digital art whenever I dislike it I think of redoing and deleting nah~~. Thanks S for holding the watercolor painting activity. The last time I tried watercolor was in my primary school ‚Äî I tried it in my diary and completely messed it up. I am so glad that I got to know so many people appreciating my painting. Love you all, especially J who bought my painting*1 in auction <3 (a forever bond; tbh I will and want to draw as many as all of u want when I am free), and I will keep drawing as my habit (mostly‚Ä¶ after my college app). Also, many thanks to all of you who supported my quest, though I haven't finished yet ~~not procrastinating trust~~.

I have been a slow burner for 17 1/12 years. Apparently I am bad at learning from past camps ‚Äî just like Ross '23, which I regret I didn‚Äôt join in many activities but instead was a nerd doing psets all day long. This situation, luckily, has been improved in Ross '24[13](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-13-148573217). But I always need a second chance to finish things without regret, while it does not appear every time. When I got off the car from PVG to home, the 30+ Celsius degree hot air started catalyzing my post-camp depression ‚Äî it reminded me that I am no longer in Oxford, where I need to put on outerwear or a blanket. So did black tea at home, the weak ac, and mostly, the gradually-deepening ache of absence and loneliness served by an empty room. I count myself fortunate, for though ASPR, WARP, and SPARC hold their own allure, none could replace the unique experience I've encountered in ESPR. When D asked me which program I preferred ‚Äî ASPR or WARP ‚Äî I chose ASPR doubtlessly since ASPR offered a chance to travel to Taiwan freely (so ironic to think that the Chinese gov helped me by stopping me from going to ASPR..?). SPARC, with its overlap with Ross, was not in consideration. And it turns out that each twist of fate, each decision, brought me here, and I‚Äôm grateful that the threads wove together to craft this unforgettable journey.

Mom comforts me when I meet awful people by saying that people are like raindrops[14](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-14-148573217), sliding quickly down the window of life and they have nearly 0 impact on my life. But what if I really want you to stay in my life? I wish gravity didn't exist, so they could linger on my window longer. If that's not possible, then please, please, at least splash against the glass and reappear in my life. ÂÜçËßÅ, we shall meet again.

P.S. Huge thanks to K for that generous praise, u r so sweet and it‚Äôs very exciting news for someone who messed up every single literature class since primary school <3

i really miss the time i chatted with CK abt space & time stuff, zeno‚Äôs paradox, etc etc nearly a year ago (it even became an answer for one question in aspr application lol)

this part was probably originally written when i was in airport (morning of Aug 25)

thanks CW I am now revising again and listening to the blend. ur the goddess in playlists. ‚Äî me 9:13 on Aug 27

[8](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-8-148573217)

and now (20:31 on Sept 6) i am again listening to our blend 

[9](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-9-148573217)

the blend is better, tho i sometimes saw songs that i didn‚Äôt add to my playlist marked as my taste just because i just simply clicked on revelation by gem (the separate single covers are really beautiful :fire:) too many times during ross, and later on Spotify just started filling my queue with the repeating awful songs 

[10](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-10-148573217)

SK is cute but i really fucked up that convo with her and i felt so bad in communicating with others maybe i should practice more

[11](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-11-148573217)

in general not only the half-haunted queen‚Äôs college dorm 

[12](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-12-148573217)

especially when I am less mature than my peers which was claimed by my middle school teacher as ‚Äúinnocent & childish‚Äù 

[13](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-13-148573217)

at least participated in the Jeopardy and also helped with the quiz bowl! family foosball was also fun and i got the chance to touch grass frequently! slacked thru all my psets tho LOL

[14](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/gravityless-raindrops-on-the-window#footnote-anchor-14-148573217)

worth doubting, sometimes feel like they are more like birdpoops ‚Äî hard to wash off
