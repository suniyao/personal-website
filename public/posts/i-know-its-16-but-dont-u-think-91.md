since the start of the spring semester i have been way too energetic than i was in the fall semester, and when others were sweating abt college results coming out i was trying to throw this back and instead focus on 

  * packing up

  * learning more web dev stuff so that i don’t feel completely lost during the workshops 




because i was heading to boston for my first hackathon!! 😎✨

though everyone’s reaction towards that was why (are u going now because it’s nearly PG aka predicted grade mock exam weeks) and how (did u decide to go to a hackathon because when did u start doing cs[^1], i have claimed several times that i still think i make a _rational_ choice based on the advantages i got from this little vacation off school. this is also basically a record of what i did in the travel so no main focus at all lol i did enjoy writing this to remember even the smallest things i encountered 

## feb 25-28: chomp chomp chomp

i headed to PVG on tuesday morning with decent KFC breakfast takeaway and took a few pics and videos to instruct my grandparents who were going to fly to the US[^2] in late March how they can use the Delta app to check in and reclaimed that they don’t need to register whatever membership which they failed after trying many times. it was also the first time i had a formal meal in #69 lounge

for the first three days i was been hosted by a college applying consultant aka physics contests coach / research tutor aka a physics professor at Nanjing University[^3] Wendy and we shared a double in her apartment. i got to know her from last year’s participation in HMMT since she was my teammate’s consultant. Wendy has been staying in lexington for about 2 months to spend time with her children who’re taking high school & university. it was really lucky that she was planning to go back to China on Feb 28th otherwise if it was earlier she would not be able to host me[^4]. (and my mom was having very different opinions on travelling from me, in short she considered average cost per day while i do total cost so i was very fine just travelling there for a weekend ~~sounds really strange but i don’t mind flying over half the earth just for better mental health~~ while she’s like if u’re only going there for a weekend it sounds less reasonable… 💀) i was basically studying, reviewing (a little bit for the mock exams), eating, yapping, playing electronic piano in her apartment, and meeting up with friends. 

i received much caring from Wendy and her son Brady & daughter Jenny :) arrived at about 10pm but Jenny still cooked pork and garlic chives jiaozi for us. i’ll say i love the pork one but can’t really accept the garlic chives flavor as a southern Chinese [^5] 😭

the next day i woke up actually at about 6am but lay in bed until it was 7 when Wendy was also up, and had a really nice sandwich made by Jenny! they also surprisingly had a coffee machine and i was allowed to do some [latte art](https://www.reddit.com/r/notinteresting/comments/1jcplbf/the_barista_made_a_heart_for_my_husband_but_not/)

grinding latte art! the coffee machine has a thicker steam tube than my school’s coffee shop one so rip the first morning’s was a kinda failed test and the next morning’s was better lol 
</div>

the evening Wendy was out to have supper with a UMass AO and i was dropped off near harvard square to meet with Ashley who i met from Ross '23, I got pho and Ashley also shared some of her fried rice with me and they were both tasty, like out of expectation (my last time having pho is tbh not enjoyable my parents and i chose a random vietnamese restaurant in Shanghai and it was expensive[6](https://stepyao.substack.com/p/i-know-its-16-but-dont-u-think-91#footnote-6-158909990) glad i tried again so that i don’t impose hate on all pho restaurants)

1) when i reviewed my photo gallery i realized i took a screenshot of bp staff's dining recs but actually didn't use it at all skullers tho coincidentally still tried Le's at least 2) i told Ashley i felt i might never be able to understand what english menu was talking abt and she was like "i always use translator" and holy shit ur so rightttt but anyways "脆脆的春卷 新鲜的夏卷" is just funny for no reason 3) harvard-themed password
</div>

we also got osmanthus boba from tea one teahouse! so decent compared to indiana random small town’s boba that was just low-quality milk tea powder in strange flavor (blueberry / mint / watermelon?? like wHAt iS ThAT) + water + maybe 2 full teaspoons of sugar. i was thinking “i need to be healthier” ( _relatively_ ) and chose the 50% sugar but still underestimated the average American sweetness standard and it was sweet as hell. then i visited her dorm in harvard yard and yapped abt college life / internships / REUs / _observed_ her doing cross-registrated algebraic combinatorics mit course pset and was a bit jet-lagged and fell half-asleep when sitting on her bed 💀after she finished (like 9:30pm) we also went to annenberg just to fill up our nearly-finished boba with milk and hopefully felt much healthier ~~no we are not~~ then

the next day for breakfast we ate [chicken nuggets](https://youtu.be/Q8REcF4MRjQ) and pancakes, it was also the first time i tried using the cream dispenser and had so much fun accidentally spraying the cream on my hand and everywhere and cleaning it up

before lunch i asked Wendy if we can go to costco for shopping. given last year’s experience of buying health supplements for my wai-po and wai-gong[^7] and my confusion of why dad was relatively unhappy abt that — the main reason why i didn’t choose health supplements for my ye-ye and nai-nai[^8] is just because they were so healthy in every way and i can’t find any products in costco which fit them[^9] and they also hate health supplements??!! — so this time i just bought something for my parents aka generous sponsors so this is equal again. (after i got back to Shanghai i finally realized that the gift does not necessarily be supplements from costco 💀 npc moments forgive me and i promise i’ll do it the next time)

we were going for the roast chicken too! last year, my three HMMT teammates and i basically lived off that — we took it out of the fridge and reheated it three times to finish it and we all loved it

in the evening both Jenny and Wendy went out, and Brady was at home. we first went to the library nearby and saw some very cheap second-hand books and i bought two with only $4 — one was a novel with a decent rating on goodreads and the other one was a taiwanese comic book on introduction to Zhuang Zhou philosophy which seemed to be high quality. on the way to the library and back he also introduced a bit of lexington downtown / lexington high school to me. tbh before i didn’t realize this lexington is the exact place of the famous _shot heard 'round the world_. i originally thought it was just the same name. if [x] happened in Pudong Shanghai we will only refer it to [x] in Shanghai instead of in Pudong to represent a greater area which everybody knows while Americans generally seem more related to the small town they lived in. ig this might be a cultural thing? ~~counterexample: tiananmen 1989 and we dont call it as beijing 1989~~

the third day was a relatively healthy day with traditional chinese breakfast and lunch made by Wendy — sweet congee with red date & longan, boiled egg with soy sauce, and fried rice for lunch. after relying on metro in shanghai for 2+ years i count taking public transportation as a step to explore a place so i was about to take the bus and red line to harvard. however, when i took my luggage to the bus stop at 5:30pm the bus driver overlooked me and drove away even though i tried hard signaling him by waving my arms[^10]. so i tried calling an uber but realized it still restricted me for the stupid reason that i’m not an adult yet and lyft just failed randomly (claimed my billing address is incorrect 💀) so i ended up went back to the apartment[^11] and Jenny helped me call a lyft

## feb 28 - mar 2: pretending i’m a student here

went to harvard again to meet up with Teresa! had dinner at annenberg, and before that, she texted me saying the food wasn’t good at all and i shouldn’t expect much — it’s really just about the fancy dining hall. i kind of doubted her at first and thought maybe she just had high standards. but when i saw the long food bar filled with four identical sequences of dishes, i realized okay yeah, maybe she wasn’t tripping

<div class="caption">
honestly awful — especially the pumpkin and the tuna. the pumpkin was like a rock with sweet roast chicken sauce smeared on top, and it literally made me cringe in disgust 💀❓
</div>

i also got a pear and a banana — the banana was way too rare, and the pear was just weird. it was supposed to be crispy, but it turned out kind of soft. i thought it might be a Belgian conference pear and got super excited!! since I loved those (though I probably haven’t had one since primary school). But it turned out to be just a pretty bad common pear, and I ended up tossing the other half

we didn’t really stay long since she’s busy heading to a concert lol so i headed to the science center and stayed there for a while before going to MIT. while i was grinding two tourists came and asked me “excuse me do u know where the restroom is” and i was confused and said “oh sry im also a visitor here 💀”. ~~yeah like definitely reasonable for a visitor to pull out laptop from backpack and stayed there for like more than half an hour typing up things~~

from feb 28 - mar 2 when the blueprint was actually running i was hosted by Janet aka my favourite 8 year old aka dearest host aka coolest bp director orzorz! 

my way to MIT was luckily successful — after i studied in the science center for a while i realized it’s time to catch on the bus to MIT! i ran through the harvard yard with my luggage and looked really awkward when i need to turn to a sideway gate to the bus since the main gate got closed and nearly went on the wrong one. i caught on the bus right before it’s heading off though my credit card also didn’t work so i need to pay with my coins and one quarter dollar also dropped out of the bus the driver looked at me as if i’m an idiot 💀

when i reached burton conner Janet was not back yet so i hang around outside: there were two students sitting on the bench and loud rock music came out from i dont know which window / basement possibly. i wait for a while and realized maybe i should at least take a whatever peek at the figma tutorial because the last time i used UI design tool was like 2 yrs ago (for a business project?? and i took like 10 hrs on the UI and even though for every single formal exam i got 5/7 i got 7/7 for the project probably because the business management teacher thought i put enough effort in tyty i claim i also tried hard for the exams business management is just a super hard subject which i cannot understand how to answer) though i had a harder time connecting to the MIT-GUEST network and while i was sitting on the bench dealing with my laptop janet came LOL[^12]

while i’m waiting outside of BC 💀 i sometimes think my body is way too magical with 2 hrs less sleep needed compared to normal ppl and higher heartbeat (for reference when i ran through the harvard yard its ~189 bpm iirc and normal resting heartrate is ~110bpm) tho this is mostly due to nervousness

for the two days i got a very rare healthy sleeping schedule from 1am to 6am (better than my normal `random.randint(1,4)`am - 7:45am) and also chipped in a bit of chores to help. i felt a lil awkward wearing the HMMT Feb 2024 highly-saturated green t-shirt so put on blueprint swag as soon as i got it but it turned out so funny that since i was wearing the swag many participants / also some staff thought i was also organizer LMAO including a few fellow participants asking me how to check in and orgs fair speaker requesting if i could get her an extra desk

i took the advanced web dev track and was glad that i learned some react nodejs and things in advance so that i didnt get lost in the middle. tho for a while i didn’t realize `branch` and `checkout` are used to switch to different steps and make sure we are following and i was panicking what should i do after checkout because all my coded lines and comments were gone 💀💀 my virtual environment also stopped working during the workshop and i was so confused why i cannot install nodejs (like it just stucked after executing the install command) in my windows system until the 3rd workshop when a cracked instructor helped me solve it orz orz many thanks

my bp teammates all have attended hackathons before so they were experienced especially Avishi who has competed in 6 before and started coding at 7 tho still a sophomore studying algebra?? with them three i got a sense of how hackathon works. we brainstormed many ideas after the workshops and chose one, specified how many pages and functions we are going to include and who’s going to work on back/front end design. for me since i’m more familiar with frontend stuff so i was asked to build a figma UI prototype the night before the hackathon, and it was really useful during the hackathon because i don’t need to think of the layout but just code it up, referring to the figma project. 

we decided to take one of the ideas called “DailyCode” as what we are going to work on: it gives everyday prompts for broader interest-driven programming which is where it differs from CP/codeforces with upvotes/downvotes on others projects (like stackexchange), leaderboard, project cards for everyone who submitted. imo it might seem to be more interesting if more functions are built but with the prototype built in 8hrs i kinda felt it somewhat lacks creativity. (i also mentioned a coworking meetup map like a high school class can generate a unique session code and enter everyone’s college and have a beautified map of where everyone is but it got discarded because the subject is too casual and they changed it to a map of NGOs to make it _greater_ but appeared to be less reasonable so it got ditched sobbing)

i also met up with Brian from 9 to 10pm! turns out he was hosting Bruce — the other Ross + BP participant. the connections between math comp kids are honestly wild. we went to teado since it was probably the only place still open within walking distance, and i ended up having takoyaki for dinner ~~at 9pm~~. While we were chatting, we noticed a girl at the next table who _really_ looked like Ashley — and it actually _was_ her! she was working with Peter, who was Ross '23 Ohio, so we accidentally stumbled into a bigger meetup: 3 Indiana + 2 Ohio kids 😎. also had a great time grinding [set with friends](http://setwithfriends.com) with friends.

The next day was HACKATHON DAY RAHHHH — and it kicked off with me dropping GoGurt multiple times when we were trying to carry them to the media lab 💀. I had them stacked on top of cool plus but every time I took a few steps, the GoGurts would slowly start sliding off ahhhhh and then drop to the ground. so we ended up calling a cool staff who owns a car 🙏 and she drove us there.

the time i took the pic i didn’t realize it’s so hard holding the evil GoGurts but i made them <i>pay back</i> by eating 3 during hackathon iirc 😎
</div>
i did come up with a better solution of using my puffer to wrap those up and hold the entire puffer wrap LMAO but was asked to put it back on by Janet since i was only wearing 2 clothes then. i still need to claim:

$$(-7^\circ \text{C}=19^\circ \text{F})_{\text{Boston}}>(9^\circ \text{C}=48^\circ \text{F})_{\text{Shanghai}}$$

aka boston cold is MID[^13].

the biggest mistake i made at the hackathon is suggesting that we can use a VSCode extension called live share because it actually did not work well after we added nodejs extensions (only the session host can see it so the nodejs run on host side only) and the terminal became a mess and unreadable while its still _half-functioning_. i made our backend teammate the host so that the 2 backend ppl can still use it to collaborate and i switched to local files since it worked better for me[^14]. my other frontend teammate works on styling tho later i realized the main focus was kinda wrong because she was tweaking on some particle effect background 😭 also i now suggest everyone using macbook during hackathon because they usually have better battery to at least survive through an 8hr-hackathon than windows. our windows sucked, including:

  * mine which forced me staying away from our table because i need to charge after only 4 hours of coding

  * my teammate's device has this cursed “charging pose”. the probability of it actually charging depends strictly on getting that position right, and we've all been told not to _dare_ touch anything once it starts charging LMAO.




the 8 hours actually ran faster than i supposed, after “f*ck why this does not work” “sh\*t its because of [some strange reasons why our code crashes including MIT GUEST does not support MongoDB deployment] that does not even make sense” “WTF” “erm what the…” “SIGMA?” it was approaching the end. after debugging the last 2 emergencies we submitted our project and started looking around. many ppl built very significant projects (tbh mit-related high school events always have so many strong competitors orzorz) and it was interesting to ask what utilities their projects have. one team thought i was a grader and gave me a well-prepared full presentation 😭

this place gives fancy high tech vibes especially in the elevator

it was about 10:40pm when we were back to BC, and this time i did feel tired. because actually i had been awake with my full energy since 6am, including half of the time hacking and physically up for the other 8hrs ~~compared to my normal school days which i seemed to be up but most time my brain not functioning that much~~

nah i wish i am 💀 i have been back for a month and a half but it still shows that (fun fact: my IP address should be UWaterloo in Canada due to my vpn proxy)
</div>

## so what do i actually get from this?

apparently we didn’t get an award, but also as a senior attending this flying across the pacific ocean and america i’m not here for award, so i’d instead make a list of what i valued in this journey

  * better mental health ofc, i stopped thinking abt college results coming out for a whole week, tho i did open a waitlist from [a mid safety school that sucks](https://illinois.edu/) because of overqualification on feb 28th but who actally cares when later you are going to see your friends that you miss a lot?

  * my first experience of hackathon! i finally know how it works. tbh i was thinking 8hrs is very short and instead we should do 12hrs but actually it’s more tiring than i expected? next time when i’m in a hackathon i will: 

    * use git instead of risking trying some unstable extensions from VSCode

    * come with a macbook (bye my old pc i can’t wait for ur retirement after i graduate from high school) 

    * be better equipped with more backend knowledge!! backend seems fun and i also started doing a project by myself with DB deployment i learned in adv web dev workshop 4 i’m locking in >:)

  * lots of love and caring from friends 😭♥️ 

    * especially advice from Janet that i should learn how to 立威 (?) 💀 this sounds hard to achieve when you are dealing with a bunch of toxic Chinese intl high school burnt-out students who are all trying to emphasize their portion in the activity 💀 but actually aren’t that skilled in doing actual work[^15] 💀💀💀 instead of mit students 🔥🔥🔥 but at least this time i tried to distribute the work down and it was done with reasonable quality comparing to last time!! ig i have more 🔥 kids this time. so i only spent like 2 hours on the disgusting dumb compiling work[^16] (does not include piecewise time of contacting every kid to do their work and tell them how to do their work) and it’s more well-organized than last time which i wasn’t able to sleep until 4am :’) 

      * also its nice that we recruited more people this time so the relative workload put down to every student is simple and maybe thats why they are willing to do it

      * trust i did grow. i told my fellow i can also help around with problem writing and she just gave me the heaviest work 💀 before i’ll probably accept it even though i’ll secretly groan ~~and cry~~ at late night asking myself why i have to help with this annoying work while others think “oh arent u _just_ helping with additional stuffs of copy-pasting problems from one file to another” yes but things get completely different if you need to do that for **120 times**. so this time i told my fellow organizer okay kid for reference we have 9 people dealing with the same amount of work in more than a month and u mean i myself should do all the work in like less than a week there is no way even if i’m a senior 💀💀💀 so i just sent in the gc if anyone would be okay to help and was fully prepared to have no one willing to do such work and i have to stay up to 4 again but we have better workers and they replied 😭 the kids grow up (okay tbh i dont think they are the same bunch of kids so 💀)

i died with the “problem writer <b>s</b> , test solver <b>s</b> , compiler <b>(s)</b> ”???
</div>

  * i understood more about technical stuff! also finally actually know abt and get interested in hacking!! blueprint cute swags!! hack club and its stickers are also soooo amazing :)

  * i think i love volunteering around — maybe because i get to meet more people, maybe not, since the time is usually short, maybe it’s just funny when people ask if i’m an MIT student who joined to help out, and i replied i’m a high schooler hehe. but honestly, it’s mostly because it’s just fun and cool. plus, i love being given clear commands?

  * lovely polaroid pic :)

  * to stay hydrated

  * to have a better sleeping schedule

  * to stop checking my phone in bed 💀💀💀




wow this appeared to be a super long post and i yapped harder than i did in my extended essay. i finished much earlier but procrastinated on posting this and this is now abt 7 weeks later (wait already??) i’ll grind on something else now :)

[^1]: okay ig i gave too much math nerd vibes but i also did some cp??? also some fancy stuff 💀 idk when i’ll be qualified to be called cs sellout tho LOL

[^2]: to help out my uncle & cousin who moved to Ohio last summer and will be back in July. half worrying abt how i will adapt to this change but whatever now i have been shipping every single important international mail there since September because i was traumatized after losing my Physics WOOT merch in 2023 when it was shipped to China. hope my uncle would be ready to be bombed by my mails including free books/stickers/merch/swags i got. my obsession for them validates they are super important

[^3]: sometimes i still feel very magical how union set of these three is not an empty set

[^4]: basically this is an awkward misunderstanding that i thought bp week is offline (literally does not make sense at all) and realized that it was not so i planned to cold-DM everyone i knew who might possibly host me for the weekdays nights and got really lucky since she’s the first one i reached out to orzorz

[^5]:“oh are u from the north! i’ve never had garlic chive jiaozi before tho my mom liked garlic chives” and ate 2 but can’t really eat after that

[^6]: same price as this, ~$14 but consider the purchasing power parity difference between the US and China

[^7]: grandparents on my mom’s side but i gave up calling them as that since this is so messy

[^8]: grandparents on my dad’s side

[^9]: i claimed this was instead something he should be happy abt but apparently he didn’t accept this claim and thought i was being careless

[^10]: it should be super obvious because i was holding my luggage but it turned out that he just passed by leaving me standing there desperately

[^11]: a miracle for me that i successfully went back from the bus stop to their apartment because i didn’t try remembering it at all and luckily found the right building by pulling up a photo i took at their apartment and searching up its location

[^12]: why is here an LOL? my equivalent expression to HI GUYS AM I PREPARED I THINK NO I THINK IM COOKED

[^13]: just checked boston weather now tbh the very long winter is kinda depressing

[^14]: i forget why we insisted on using that shit LMAO we should just use github and git 😭🙏

[^15]: HOLY SHIT GUYS THAT LITERALLY INCLUDES ME 🤡

[^16]: tbh i got more and more annoyed by latex somehow i mean especially when my pc stucked and when others think i can always just do these for them for free like BRO ITS NOT HARD TO LEARN THIS SHIT AT ALL
