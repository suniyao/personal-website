‚Äúextracting music notes from chords by applying and improving fourier transform‚Äù is the title of my extended essay. i finished it[^1], started enjoying music[^2], felt relief, but at the same time, the mixed void limbo just kicked the mind-door ‚Äî i live in the wrap of music.

i realized that constantly playing music has been a silent rule in my life, i hardly turned them off. i should admit that when i was thinking of difficult problems or focused i could not really hear them. and they might also be a source of distraction, yet i still have that hobby.

late december 2022 i had frequent quarrels with my parents (and every single one of them turned out to be ~defeated by parents~) because i like to put on my earphones. they stated that by this i was unable to listen to what they talked to me. yes, it was disrespectful, so i avoided later on because i didn‚Äôt want to end up wiping my tears using napkins in the dining room after getting yelled againgaingain üíÄ 

but living in the wrap of music is delightful, i enjoy the moment sitting in an empty seat in the first row of the classroom, cold ac air is blowing directly towards my shank while wet hotwind is flowing in from the opening window and sinking to the ground. the music coming out of earphones is the one that they like, and i miss them. 

music acts with the memorial function for me, marking timesets that are very important to my life. i can still remind myself of the time i first listened to One Last Kiss, 6:48am a june morning before school. i took 2 bottles of milk for my friend and me and i can still stay home for 4 minutes, so i turned on my music app to listen to the auto-rec; lying on my new bed after ~10 days of moving in a new home and listening to Long Kiss Good Bye from a 3hrs Naruto video clip multiple times by just adjusting the slider before middle school graduation ceremony; i played Taylor Swift‚Äôs ME! every day on the public computer in 6th grade when doing classroom cleaning-up; the day i was listening to 1999 by Charli xcx and Troye Sivan on the wireless pod, i finally got the acceptance letter from the middle school; I listened to „É™„Éä„É™„Ç¢ on the way to my grandparents‚Äô home from middle school after comp training in june 2021; crying with Nanimono by Yonezu Keshi after receiving high school acceptance because i don‚Äôt want to leave my friends that i studied hard just to be together with them[^3]; grinding comp programming is associated with A Rainy Morning from Garden of Words; GEM marks ross '23 and '24 ~~together with some sk*b*d* d*lutions~~[^4].

sometimes i feel like i am stuck in the past just as my music taste ‚Äî i do constantly fill my playlists with more songs, but i get bored easily and just scroll long down to listen to songs i liked 2-3 years ago. but there‚Äôs definitely something changing. 

i left school and Shanghai early on the last day of September to go back to Huzhou to see old friends in the high school that i _should be_ studying in[^5]. it turned out to be a failure of estimation for the traffic jam severeness right before the long national holiday and took me about 5 hours (which should be 3 hours normally) from my school to home, while my friends all left school even 1 hour before. but i still had a phone call with one close friend, and we talked about how life has been going for both of us. she shared with me that she‚Äôs aiming for Peking and Tsinghua, and asked how applying for US colleges worked for me, also requested me to talk with her in English (imagine you just randomly started speaking English in a car filled with other 4 strangers, crazily embarrassing). she tried to be sounding _mean_ and _mad_ to the fact that i couldn‚Äôt come on time but she was trolling ~~or maybe she‚Äôs not~~. i also had a meal with my other closest friend for 12 years since primary school LOL. sharing about what has happened made us feel like we haven‚Äôt changed much. we used to be two overlapped circles and now both of us just shift outwards a bit, but still, we have intersections (like a typical A intersecting with B Venn diagram). 

but i cannot tell whether missing the chance to see old friends should be accompanied by a sense of relief (still, i did try my best to be on time). i avoid having general connections with old friends. i miss them, and i do want to stay in touch, but my fear of ‚Äúwhat if i won‚Äôt appreciate her updated version‚Äù weighs much more. what if we may have really changed based on completely different life traces, and our views and interests are just mutually exclusive? i build up perfect versions for people i know and they are static, and they are outdated, and as i avoid face-to-face interactions with them they are never going to get updated. 

~~fortunately, or unfortunately, whatever, this is at least not the case for my 12-year friend because we really are just as childish as we were in primary school and i feel safe enough that neither of us is going to change _rapidly_~~

but did i change a lot from who i was 3 years ago? definitely yes. i got bored of pressing shift at the beginning of every sentence and every ‚ÄúI‚Äù (something i wondered a lot since primary school is what‚Äôs special about ‚ÄúI‚Äù that you have to capitalize it); i just purchased a mouse to learn blender and got used to it; i tried to reflect and record more than i did before; i started value liberal arts more (which is tough but i at least tried to convince myself that yes they are interesting!!); i got better at piano freestyling and song transcribing, and my left hand got bigger[^6]; i now prefer to made new friends with different intended majors because i can get more inspirations from them; i care less of how people view me[^7]; i also learned that making myself looking unhinged sometimes acts as a camouflage.

monthly updates:

this month has been really busy and stressful for me? hopefully, i kinda survived with some ‚ú®unexpected good luck‚ú®:

  * both the chem and physics exams are _kinda hard_ and i got 1 point above the 7 boundaries for both LOL did make many stupid mistakes

  * got A for my extended essay and i am actually proud of myself because i might create real contribution (!!) in the subject that i am interested in instead of just doing junk research by paraphrasing existing papers and plagiarizing github code[^8]

  * got A in TOK: i was kinda depressed the weekend before TOK exam because i thought the composition of eg grade contained the exhibition poster (scored 6/10) instead of the exhibition commentary (8/10)[^9] and thought i need to have 8/10 for the monthly essay. did get 8/10 though which is pretty out of expectation!ü´£ 




besides, college app is starting[^10] and it has been killing my mental state. my mind oscillates between having a very risky reach, a less risky reach, and a relatively safe college app plan literally EVERYDAY. good news is that i feel like after ESPR my ability to write reflective messages has improved and my school counselor: ‚Äúyo what your draft surprised me it _actually looks like_ a personal statement.‚Äù

but anyway, the expected grade exam is, at least, over and i allowed myself a short break to play video games, learn math and fancy things[^11], draw[^12]!

[^2]: not ‚Äústart listening to‚Äù cuz my spotify player just never stopped

[^3]: this is a crazy statement but a reference/flag/model/idol is really effective for me when i am losing my incentive because i think abt ‚Äúbc she‚Äôs good at this i should also be good and i should solve the problem she can‚Äôt huh huh‚Äù

[^4]: the next should be espr but if i try to think abt songs that specifically marked ESPR, there are actually none and i am glad abt it because it means i turned off music to (try to) socialize! 

[^5]: got accepted, went there in advance to study some comp stuff in the last year of middle school but i then decided to turn to intl high school and trolled them oopsies 

[^6]: and no comments on my right hand

[^7]: i.e. i am now wearing a green t-shirt and a red shorts and i won‚Äôt feel inappropriate just walking out with this outfit to buy sushi from the nearby convenient store

[^8]: i am sure i won‚Äôt get an A if i chose literature. it would be a solid B and i won‚Äôt be proud of my work AT ALL

[^9]: it is actually (average of DP1 + exhibition commentary + essay) so 8+8+8 out of 30 ‚Üí A, i was even thinking ‚Äúbruh idgaf if u give me a B already got A in EE so anyways it‚Äôs A+A/B=3 

[^10]: while for CK it already ended, rip UChicago SSEN student, she‚Äôs the first offer receiver for 25fall at least in China LOL
