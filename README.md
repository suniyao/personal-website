my personal website, 2.0 version because the 1.0 version was made a long time ago and it looked bad with static html and css and bad design. i learned react framework and next.js a while ago, so that helped me coded a better version. It contains my most up to date resume, a hover on live photo (which is a creative idea imo), spotify live update listening widget, project page, blogs/updates with markdown posts parsed to html page and many customized style (please use dark mode to view it by now), latex support, etc.

what i struggled with: spotify api, formatting, markdown to web page and more struggle with customization, when developing with next.js my localhost does not show up every font that it's supposed to (i.e. Zen Old Mincho, such a nice font for japanese) so have to deploy and see how it looks like.
